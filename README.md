🛰️ Mission Log: Movie Recommendation System

Mission Objective:
Scrape IMDb’s Top 250 Movies list, extract key data (title, year, rating), and recommend the highest-rated one.
This mission demonstrates how beginner astronauts (coders 👩‍🚀👨‍🚀) can combine Selenium and BeautifulSoup to explore dynamic web content.

✨ Features

📡 Data Collection: Captures movie titles, release years, and IMDb ratings.

🧮 Decision System: Automatically recommends the highest-rated movie from your scrape.

🛠 Dynamic Web Handling: Uses Selenium to render JavaScript-heavy pages.

📝 Formatted Output: Displays a list of movies in a clean, readable format.

🧰 Mission Prerequisites

Before launch, make sure you have the right tools in your command module:

Python 3.x → Download

Libraries:

pip install selenium beautifulsoup4


Google Chrome (your spacecraft window 🌌).

ChromeDriver → Download here
 (must match your Chrome version).

Place chromedriver in your project directory or add it to system PATH.

🚀 Installation & Launch

Verify Python:

python --version


Install Libraries:

pip install selenium beautifulsoup4


Get ChromeDriver:

Check your Chrome version (Menu → Help → About Google Chrome).

Download matching ChromeDriver.

Place it inside your movie-recommender folder.

Create Mission Folder:

mkdir movie-recommender && cd movie-recommender


Save script as:
movie_recommender.py

Launch Mission:

python movie_recommender.py

🛰 Sample Mission Output
🎬 Recommendation: The Shawshank Redemption (1994) - Rating: 9.2

📋 Scraped Movies:

2. The Godfather (1972) - Rating: 9.1
3. The Dark Knight (2008) - Rating: 9.0
...

🛑 Troubleshooting

No movies found? → Inspect IMDb’s page (Right-click → Inspect) and update selectors in code.

Selenium errors? → Make sure ChromeDriver matches your Chrome version.

Weird ratings or missing info? → IMDb often changes CSS classes. Keep your selectors up to date.

🔬 Mission Walkthrough

Selenium Launch: Spins up a Chrome window in headless mode (stealth mode 🕶).

Page Fetch: Visits https://www.imdb.com/chart/top/.

BeautifulSoup Parsing: Reads the HTML delivered by Selenium.

Data Extraction:

Title → <h3 class="ipc-title__text">

Year → <span class="cli-title-metadata-item">

Rating → <span class="ipc-rating-star--rating">

Recommendation Engine: Picks the highest-rated movie from your scraped list.

Mission Success: Outputs both the recommendation and your scraped data.

⚠️ Limitations

Dynamic Selectors: IMDb classes like sc-15ac7568-0 often change. Be ready to adjust.

Requires Selenium: IMDb renders with JavaScript, so requests-only scraping won’t cut it.

Ethics & Compliance: Always check IMDb’s robots.txt
. For production, consider APIs like OMDb
.

🌌 Future Mission Enhancements

Add genre filtering (“Show me only Sci-Fi 🚀”).

Implement user preferences (e.g., min rating = 8.5).

Cache data to avoid hitting IMDb too often.

Switch to OMDb API for more stable long-term missions.

🤝 Join the Crew

This is a training mission, but the shuttle has plenty of seats:

📝 Add new features (genre filter, export CSV).

🔧 Fix bugs when IMDb changes their layout.

🌍 Translate this tool for global movie fans.

Fork, contribute, and make this the ultimate movie co-pilot.

📜 License

For educational missions only. Respect IMDb’s terms of service when scraping.
